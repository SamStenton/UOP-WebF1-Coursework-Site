					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>
						As a student of Computer Science I get access to a virtual machine. To access the machine I first need to switch it on via the <a href="https://uop-1-server-per-student-prod.appspot.com/instance/get">web console.</a> Once the VM status is showing "RUNNING" I can login to it using a dedicated SSH program or through my terminal by running the command <code>ssh up778465@put.ip.address.here</code>
					</p>

					<p>
						Before being able to upload code to the VM and start running it I should be able to edit it first. Most operating systems come with a default text editor to edit code in but these can be very limited in functionality. Rich and Jack recommended that we used <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> which is an open source editor created by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. For the past couple years my text editor of choice has been <a href="">Sublime Text 3</a> which is a paid editor similar to Atom. I have used both editors extensively but have found myself getting frustrated at the sluggish nature of Atom compared to sublime - for now I will be sticking to Sublime however there are rumors that development on the editor has stopped so I could be jumping ship soon!
					</p> 

					<p>The last part of the introduction was a quick overview of the upcoming coursework and some extra reading around the HTML5 specification.</p>
				</article>

				<article id="markup">
					<h3>Introduction to Markup</h3>
					<p>
						In the this second week we were given a lecture on on HTML Markup. This outlined the basic usage of the language.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E; &#x3C;!-- Sets the document as HTML5 --&#x3E;
&#x3C;html&#x3E; &#x3C;!-- Start of HTML tags --&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x3C;head&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x9;&#x3C;title&#x3E;&#x3C;/title&#x3E; &#x3C;!-- Anything inside here gets put in the browser title --&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x3C;/head&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x3C;body&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x9;&#x3C;!-- Main Content Goes here --&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x3C;/body&#x3E;
&#x3C;/html&#x3E;
					</code></pre>

					<p>In the practical session we continued with using our virtual machines. In the tutorial we were asked to upload our webpage we built to the VM. Instead of FTPing into my machine I decided to instead use Git as I was already familiar with how it worked. First I used the GitHub client to upload my source files then I ran the following command on the virtual machine to download the files.</p>					
					<pre><code class="language-bash">
git clone https://github.com/SamStenton/WebF1Site
					</code></pre>

					<p>Once the code was on the VM I simply have to go in and run the following command to expose the files to the outside world via the IP address shown on the web console.</p>

					<pre><code class="language-bash">
http-server
					</code></pre>

					<h3>Separating Form and Content</h3>
					<p>
						This week we are introduced to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). By attaching a style sheet to my HTML I am able to change the web page to how I'd like it to look. First I need to create the extra document, I called my <i>app.css</i>. Next I linked the two together by placing a link tag in the head of my HTML.

					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;
&#x3C;html&#x3E;
&#x3C;head&#x3E;a
&#x9;&#x3C;title&#x3E;Web Foundations Site &#x3C;/title&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x3C;link rel=&#x22;stylesheet&#x22; href=&#x22;app.css&#x22;&#x3E;
&#x3C;/head&#x3E;
					</code></pre>

					<p>Once these were linked I was able to style any element on my page</p>

					<pre><code class="language-css">
div.demo{ 
	color: red;
	text-size: 2em;
	font-weight: bold;
	background: #fff;

}
					</code></pre>
					<p>Which creates the following:</p>
					<div class="demo">
						This is the demo text
					</div>

					<p>Although I have used an external style sheet it is possible to insert CSS style straight into the HTML document.</p>

					<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;div class=&#x22;demo&#x22; style=&#x22;color: red; text-size: 2em; font-weight: bold;&#x22;&#x3E;
&#x9;This is the demo text
&#x3C;/div&#x3E;
					</code></pre>
					<p>Or At the top of the document in style tags</p>
					<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;style&#x3E;
&#x9;    div.demo{ 
&#x9;    color: red;
&#x9;    text-size: 2em;
&#x9;    font-weight: bold;
&#x9;    background: #fff;	
    }
&#x3C;/style&#x3E;
					</code></pre>

					<p>There are three main types of CSS selectors: IDs, Classes and Block elements. IDs should only be used once -  the official HTML validate will throw an error if it detects more than one ID with the same name. Classes can be used in multiple places on a page. For example if you wanted to keep the same width throughout multiple elements on the page you'd give them all classes. Finally block elements are just HTML elements on the page like &#x3C;body&#x3E; or &#x3C;nav&#x3E;</p>

					<h3>Academic Writing</h3>
					<p>
					 	Part of the Web Foundations module is to write a literature review. The next lecture an practical was to prepare us for writing the review. The topic to be researched is "Sustainable Computing" which I feel is very broad and I'll be able to find a lot of academic material on the subject. 
					</p>
				</article>	

				<article id="media">
					<h3>Using Media</h3>
					<p>
						Media can take many different forms on the web; from images to videos to audio. HTML5 makes consuming media via the web a much easier process with built in tags that allow almost seamless output of formats. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To display an image on a page we use the &#x3C;img&#x3E; tag which includes a src field to the location of the image on the local storage and an alt tag which is used to describe the image.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;img src=&#x22;images/background.jpg&#x22; alt=&#x22;The background Image&#x22;&#x3E;
					</code></pre>
					<p>The above outputs the following</p>
					<img src="images/background.jpeg" alt="The background Image" width="250">
					<p>The &#x3C;img&#x3E; tag allows some extra attributes within itself. The main ones being width and height. By setting both these attributes you can set the image to an exact size - There can be issues however. If the aspect ratio is changed the image could appear stretched or "smushed" </p>

					<p>Before the HTML5 specification is it was very difficult to include video on a web page. This was because not all browsers supported the same implementation. Now there is a universal selector which has brought everything together</p>
					<p>
					The &#x3C;video&#x3E; allows the use of multiple formats to support as many browsers and devices as possible. These can be included with the &#x3C;source&#x3E; element within the video. 
					</p>

					<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;video controls&#x3E;
  &#x3C;source src=&#x22;video/video.mp4&#x22; type=&#x22;video/mp4&#x22;&#x3E;
  &#x3C;source src=&#x22;video/video.ogg&#x22; type=&#x22;video/ogg&#x22;&#x3E;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&#x3C;/video&#x3E;
					</code></pre>
					<p>The above would output the following</p>
					<video width="500" controls>
					  <source src="video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					  <source src="video/video.webm" type="video/webm">
					  Your browser does not support the video tag.
					</video>

				<article id="graphics">
					<h3>Graphics on The Web</h3>
					<p>With the advent of faster and faster internet the use of Media and Graphics is getting more popular. Along with images and video a large part is now the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics</a> which allows the use of Vector images in online media. Vector graphics are nothing new - they've been used in print for many years. The special thing about them is they keep their quality when scaled and have very small file sizes.</p>
	
					<ul> 
						<li>Small file sizes that compress well</li>
						<li>Scales to any size without losing clarity</li>
						<li>Looks great on large pixel displays</li>
						<li>Can be dynamically created</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>Bellow is the same SVG image just scaled differently. The total size of the image on disk is 25kb (tiny).</p>
					<div class="svg-container">
						<img src="images/homer-simpson.svg" alt="Small SVG" width="50">
						<img src="images/homer-simpson.svg" alt="Medium SVG" width="200">
						<img src="images/homer-simpson.svg" alt="Large SVG" width="350">
					</div>
				</article>

				<article id="design">
					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>Any good website will require a design before any actual content can be created. Design doesn't just include how something works questions like: Who is your client? What is the purpose of the site? Who is the target audience? Who is the competition? should be asked. </p>

					<p>As part of the design process for this very site I went through those questions, sketched out multiple designs and settled on one which I transferred over to photoshop.</p>
					<div class="photoshop">
						<img src="images/design/home.jpg" alt="Index PSD Design">
						<img src="images/design/litreview.jpg" alt="Litreview PSD Design">
					</div>

					<p>From the photoshop to this site things have changed very slightly. This shows that my design was not as complete as it could have been - even so having an idea of the direction I was heading in when coding made things much quicker and more fluid.</p>

					<p>If I was to attempt the design process again I would spend more time on it and put more of a focus on mobile layout</p>

				<article id="standards">
					<h3>Standards</h3>
					<p>Standards are a large part of building a HTML website. HTML5 is a type of standard and with it there were multiple elements added to the usable library. These don't just make it easier for coders and browsers to understand the layout of your site but can increase the standing of your space on Google.</p>

					<p>The main elements that have been introduced are the following</p>

					<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;article&#x3E; &#x3C;section&#x3E; &#x3C;nav&#x3E; &#x3C;aside&#x3E; &#x3C;header&#x3E; &#x3C;footer&#x3E;
					</code></pre>
				</article>

				<article id="editors">
					<h3>Productivity and Efficiency: Editors</h3>
					<p>Following on from the the first lecture on this module, this week we delved deeper into editors. This time customizing them to fit our needs and requirements.</p>

					<p>Both Atom and Sublime allow extensive modification through the use of configuration file, themes and plugins. I have added numerous themes and plugins to Sublime. I will demonstrate some of my favorite here. </p>

					<p>First I use a Theme that is very popular within the community at the moment. It's called the <a href="https://equinusocio.github.io/material-theme/">Material Design Theme.</a> This simplifies the feel and layout of the whole editor and keeps your focus on writing code.</p>

					<p>After setting up my theme through the multiple configuration variables I moved onto installing plugins. By far my favorite plugin is one called <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet">Emmet</a> which allows me to create code quicker. For example if I wanted a navigation menu I'd have to create multiple elements before adding in the text content - with Emmet however I only have to do the following. </p>
					<pre><code class="language-html">
nav&#x3E;ul&#x3E;li*4
					</code></pre>

					<p>When I hit tab Emmet create the structure I wanted instantly</p>
					<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;nav&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x3C;ul&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x9;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x9;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x9;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x9;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
&#x9;&#x3C;/ul&#x3E;
&#x3C;/nav&#x3E;
					</code></pre>

					<h3>Basic Server Scripting with PHP</h3>

					<p>This single lecture was only an introduction to PHP and just covered the very basics. PHP was the first programming language I learnt so I felt very at home with the tasks we were provided with</p>
				</article>

				<article id="usablity">
					<h3>Usability</h3>

					<p>Usability is a key part to any website creating process. The official definition for usability is "Usability is a measure of the effectiveness,efficiency and satisfaction with which specified users can achieve specified goals in a particular environment."</p>

					<p>In short this means that the user on a website finds it easy to complete the task they set out to do. A website aiming for good usability should focus on the following basic things</p>

					<ul class="content-left">
						<li>Clear Navigation</li>
						<li>East to learn interface</li>
						<li>Error Prevention</li>
						<li>Organized Layout</li>
					</ul>
				</article>

				<article id="accessibilty">
					<h3>Accessibility</h3>

					<p>Moving on from last week in can sometimes be difficult to define the difference between Accessibility and Usability. Accessibility doesn't mean how easy something is to access, the easiest way of defining it is by saying <strong>accessibility is equal is inclusion.</strong></p>

					<p>Millions of people are using the Internet and Websites at any one time. Not all those people can have the same experience. Many people suffer from issues like visual, auditory, cognitive and movement. In the past it could be very frustrating for some of these people to use online media. This has begun to change in recent years with the inclusion of special HTML tags like the <a href="http://heydonworks.com/practical_aria_examples/">aria tools</a>.</p>
